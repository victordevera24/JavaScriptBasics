				<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, obect-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety if reson. It is a small lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of there environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

					<li><a href="variabledeclaration.com">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="special_words">var x;</span></li>
					<li><a href="variableassignment.com">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assigns values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured n it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="special_words">var x = 10;</span></li>
					<li><a href="datatypes.com">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are Javascript primitives: Boolean - <span class="special_words">true</span> or <span class="special_words">false;</span> null - <span class="special_words">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="special_words">42</span> or <span class="special_words">3.14159</span>; String - <span class="special_words">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span>
					Array - <span class="special_words">[1, 'Coding, 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="special_words">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></li>
					<li><a href="Conditionals.com">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform differnet actions for differnet ecisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="special_words">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="special_words">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first conition is false; <span class="special_words">else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
					<li><a href="loops.com">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
					<li><a href="function.com">Function</a> Functons are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of ot as a list of instructions. as an example image we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction mamual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call out function over and over and over again.</li>
